  // 1. Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify names, locations, etc.
  // 2. Pattern matching for emails, phone numbers
  // 3. Section classification to identify different parts of the resume
  // 4. Skill extraction using keyword matching against a skills database

  // For now, we'll return mock data
