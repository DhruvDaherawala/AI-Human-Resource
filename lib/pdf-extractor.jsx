Resume for ${file.name}

This is a simulated resume text for demonstration purposes.
In a real implementation, the actual text would be extracted from the PDF file.

The extracted text would include:
- Contact information
- Professional summary
- Skills
- Work experience
- Education
- Certifications
- Projects
- And other relevant information

This text would then be processed by our ML model to extract structured information
and evaluate the candidate against job requirements.
